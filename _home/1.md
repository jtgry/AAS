**Have you seen a link or page suggesting that you send your AAS dues to treasurer@alabamaarchaeology.org via PayPal, and have never received a response?  We apologize, but there was some confusion when setting up the new website a couple of years ago.  We are working on fixing that error as soon as possible and hope to retrieve any lost information.  In the meanwhile, if sending your 2021 dues via PayPal, please send them to: alabamaarchaeology@gmail.com**
