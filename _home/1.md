The Alabama Archaeological Society is a nonprofit organization chartered under state of Alabama laws. There are no paid officers or staff. All funds come from membership dues and contributions and are used to promote the informed and scientific investigation of archaeological sites, as well as for other educational purposes. Membership is open to everyone.

UPDATE 6/23/2017:&nbsp; DUE TO FLOODING CAUSED BY TROPICAL STORM CINDY, THE AAS SUMMER MEETING HAD BEEN INDEFINITELY POSTPONED.&nbsp; WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE AND WILL TRY TO RESCHEDULE FOR LATER THIS YEAR.

**Have you seen a link or page suggesting that you send your AAS dues to treasurer@alabamaarchaeology.org via PayPal, and have never received a response?&nbsp; We apologize, but there was some confusion when setting up the new website a couple of years ago.&nbsp; We are working on fixing that error as soon as possible and hope to retrieve any lost information.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, if sending your 2017 dues via PayPal, please send them to: alabamaarchaeology@gmail.com**
