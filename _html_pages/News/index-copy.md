* Cemetery Preservation Workshop, Pond Spring: The General Joe Wheeler Home, Sponsored by the Alabama Historical Commission, Februrary 2, 2019.

* *An Ancient Canoe Canal in Gulf Shores, Alabama*, Dr. Greg Waselkov, USA's Marx Library Auditorium (Main Campus), Thursday, February 7, 2019, 6:00pm

  Local lore and circumstantial evidence have long identified a large ditch-like feature spanning the Fort Morgan Peninsula west of Gulf Shores as an ancient canal. An on-going volunteer effort organized by citizens of Gulf Shores, Alabama, has now confirmed that folk identification. Archival, geoarchaeological, and radiocarbon evidence indicates a Middle Woodland date (about 1,400 years old) for the canal, which extends for half a mile between Oyster Bay and Little Lagoon, connecting Mobile Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. This may be the westernmost ancient canoe canal yet identified in the Southeast. The City of Gulf Shores plans to highlight a preserved section of canal in a heritage trail.
