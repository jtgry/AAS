Organized in 1954, the Alabama Archaeological Society promotes informed archaeological studies and the preservation of southeastern historic and prehistoric archaeological sites. AAS members participate in surface scouting, site mapping and reporting, artifact analysis, documentation, and the excavation and preservation of archaeological sites.

AAS members represent a cross section of skills, crafts, interests, and professions from the state, across the nation, and foreign countries. Working closely with archaeological scholars, the society and its members volunteer labor on archaeological digs, report site information, and provide financial support through scholarships and grants.

Membership benefits include the Stones & Bones newsletter, the Journal of Alabama Archaeology, opportunities to work on archaeological digs, field trips to archaeological sites, and semi-annual state meetings.

The Alabama Archaeological Society summer and winter state meetings provide opportunities to meet and mingle with archaeologists and artifact collectors working throughout Alabama. The summer meeting typically includes a visit to an on-going excavation; the winter meeting includes presentations of current archaeological research in the state.

Monthly meetings and local activities are provided by regional, local, chapter organizations. Currently, AAS chapters include: Troy, Cullman, East Alabama, Muscle Shoals, Huntsville, Birmingham, Southwest Alabama, and Coosa Valley. For contact information for AAS chapters, see the Local Chapters page, here on the AAS web site.

Most professional archaeologists in Alabama are active members of AAS. Their participation in AAS activities offer new amateur and avocational archaeologists training and supervision to ensure that Alabamaâ€™s prehistoric and historic heritage is preserved and protected. In turn, the amateur archaeologists within the AAS provide invaluable assistance with the labor intensive pursuit of knowledge through archaeology.

The Alabama Archaeological Society is a nonprofit organization chartered under state of Alabama laws. There are no paid officers or staff. All funds come from membership dues and contributions and are used to investigate and document sites as well as for other educational purposes. Membership is open to everyone.
