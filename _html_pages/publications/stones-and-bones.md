Past issues of the Stones and Bones, the newsletter of the Alabama Archaeological Society are presented below, as are issues of the Birmingham Anthropological Society newsletter - the precursor to what eventually voted to become the Birmingham Chapter of the Alabama Archaeological Society.&nbsp;

Please note that these documents should be considered historical artifacts of the time in which they were produced, and they reflect the evolving nature of the society over time - as well as changing attitudes towards Native Americans and archaeological resources.&nbsp; The early issues of the Stones and Bones do not necessarily reflect the current views of the Alabama Archaeological Society, nor its Board of Directors.
