Membership in the AAS is open to everyone. The AAS membership includes a broad range of people, from those with a passing interest in archaeology or history, to people who are passionate about archaeological artifacts, to avocational archaeologists, to professional archaeologists. Membership benefits include opportunities to work with archaeologists on digs around the state, field trips to archaeological sites, semi-annual state meetings, the annual edition of the Journal of Alabama Archaeology, and the Stones & Bones newsletter.

5. Type the amount of money that you wish to send to the AAS (see the membership types and associated dues below).

6. Type a message to tell us what you are sending the money for, i.e. a donation for a particular AAS fund, or dues for a foreign family lifetime membership.
