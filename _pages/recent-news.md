# Call for Papers for the Journal of Alabama Archaeology

_The Journal of Alabama Archaeology_ is a peer-reviewed journal that provides the latest research on topics relevant to the history and archaeology of Alabama. Published by the Alabama Archaeological Society (AAS), the JAA covers a wide range of archaeological topics including prehistoric and historical archaeology of Alabama, however papers on related topics in the Southeast are welcome. The AAS welcomes submissions from professional, amateur, and/or avocational archaeologists, and students. This presents a great opportunity for graduate students to publish information on their research, and for recipients of the AAS Scholarships to highlight their research.

Subscriptions to the JAA may be obtained through membership to the AAS. Typically there is one volume per year, although these may be published based on time and budgetary restraints. Please review the Submission and Editorial Policies for guidelines below.

**Call for Papers:** In order to meet this year’s publishing requirements, we are presently seeking papers related to three topics for 2020-2021.

· _CALL FOR PAPERS 1:_ November 2019 marked the centennial of the signing of the Armistice, ending World War I and December 2019 marked the bicentennial of the State of Alabama. This is a call for papers to be incorporated into a Multi-Centennial Issue to commemorate these two events. Examples include research performed on Mabila, Territorial Capitals, Cahaba, military-related topics, or other topics related to the history of the State.

· _CALL FOR PAPERS 2:_ Stone features have been a topic of discussion for several years. This is a call for papers to address the study of stone features or mound as a whole, to be incorporated into a single issue. This may include stone features associated with prehistoric or historical archaeology.

· _CALL FOR PAPERS 3:_ Authors may submit additional articles based on research topics or other areas of interest.

**Deadline for Submission:** Papers should be submitted no later than APRIL 16, 2020.

**Publication Requirements:** Please see [https://alabamaarchaeology.org/files/authorsinfo.pdf](https://alabamaarchaeology.org/files/authorsinfo.pdf "https://alabamaarchaeology.org/files/authorsinfo.pdf")

NOTE: It is crucial that we receive submissions, and receive them on time, in order to produce a journal!

All submitted papers are subject to editorial review. Peer review is available upon request and, if the paper is accepted, it will be published with a notice of having been peer-reviewed. Short pieces on unusual or unidentified artifacts; updates on ongoing excavations; and brief newsworthy items should be submitted to “Stones and Bones,” the AAS’ newsletter. Please contact the Editor or Assistant Editors if you would like to read a current publication in archaeology and write a review for the JAA.

For more information, please contact the current Editorial Team: Dr. Heather Puckett, Dr. Greg Waselkov, Ms. Sarah Price, or Dr. Ashley Dumas at [JournalAlabamaArchaeology@gmail.com](mailto:JournalAlabamaArchaeology@gmail.com).

More information about the JAA is available at [https://alabamaarchaeology.org/journal/](https://alabamaarchaeology.org/files/authorsinfo.pdf "https://alabamaarchaeology.org/files/authorsinfo.pdf").

_The AAS Executive Board has approved a draft of a Sexual Harassment Policy that will be added to the by-laws. However, the policy must be approved by AAS members at large. The vote will take place at one of our seasonal state-wide meetings. The policy draft is presented below. Any comments or questions you have about the policy can be submitted through the website and will be discussed before the board and taken into consideration for the final draft._

***

The Alabama Archaeological Society (AAS) is committed to the creation and maintenance of an environment in which all individuals, members and non-members, are treated with respect and dignity. The AAS is a nonprofit organization chartered under state of Alabama laws and recognizes the necessity of compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws including, but not limited to, those that prohibit discriminatory practices including harassment. Therefore, the AAS will maintain a strict policy of prohibiting unlawful harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment and harassment based on race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, age, physical or mental disability or any other characteristic protected by state, federal or local discrimination laws. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, making unwanted sexual advances and/or requests for sexual favors where such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s mental, physical, and/or emotional well-being and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment. Members and nonmembers who violate this policy are subject to discipline up to and including the possibility of immediate and permanent expulsion from the society and its functions.

Examples of unlawful harassment include but are not limited to:

• Verbal conduct such as epithets, derogatory jokes or comments, slurs or unwanted sexual advances, invitations or comments.

• Visual conduct such as derogatory and/or sexually oriented posters, photography, cartoons, drawings, e-mail, text messaging, social media, or gestures.

• Physical conduct such as assault, unwanted touching, blocking normal movement.

• Threats and demands to submit to sexual requests.

• Retaliation for having reported or threatened to report unlawful harassment.

The AAS is not an adjudicating body; however, there are processes in place to support members in getting their grievances addressed when unwanted behaviors occur in the context of AAS-sponsored events and activities (e.g. conferences, editorial activities, governance events). Effective June 7, 2019, the AAS Board of Directors will receive complaints of harassment in the context of AAS settings and activities. They will ascertain the view of the complainant to determine what outcome they want and, where appropriate, will refer the complainant to the police. For incidents that occur outside the context of AAS-sponsored settings and activities, AAS members and nonmembers should seek out appropriate authorities with which to file claims of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault. Typically, the line of formal complaint is through the perpetrator’s home institution. AAS members should apprise themselves of the appropriate processes at their home institutions, as well as in the legal jurisdictions where fieldwork, meetings, and other business are conducted.

This policy is not intended to constitute legal advice. In the event of any conflict between this policy and applicable laws or institutional policy, the applicable laws or institutional policy prevails. Members and institutions are encouraged to seek their own counsel for advice regarding any specific situation.

The Alabama Archaeological Society will not tolerate sexual harassment or sexual assault of AAS meeting participants (including, but not limited to attendees, speakers, volunteers, exhibitors, AAS members, service providers, or other meeting guests) in any form. By obtaining AAS membership, registering to present or attend AAS meetings, members and participants commit to maintaining respectful and ethical relationships in accordance with the AAS policy. The Alabama Archaeological Society reserves the right to remove an individual violating this policy from organization events without warning or refund, and prohibit attendance at future AAS meetings, programs, and/or activities.
